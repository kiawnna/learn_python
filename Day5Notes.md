* Visit the website: https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/#f-strings-a-new-and-improved-way-to-format-strings-in-python
* Read the section `f-Strings: A New and Improved Way to Format Strings in Python`.
* `SKIP` the section `Arbitrary Expressions`.
* `STOP` reading when you get to `Python f-Strings: The Pesky Details`.
* Answer the questions below.
