# Instructions for Learning Python
This is the directory where we will practice Python.

You will clone down the repo and follow the instructions given in the files. To submit a project for review, you will
make a commit and push to this repo, where I can then check it.

## Daily Flow
1. Clone the repo to your computer by cd-ing into your home directory by pasting the command: `git clone https://github.com/kiawnna/learn_python.git`.
2. Open the folder in PyCharm.
3. Start with `Day1Notes.md` and follow the instructions.
4. When finished, move on to `Day1.py` and follow the instructions.
5. When you think you have the correct answers in `Day1Notes.md`, and you think your program runs correctly in `Day1.py`,
add your changes and make a commit.
6. Push your changes to the `homework` branch, *not* the master branch, and create a `pull-request` to the master branch.
7. `DO NOT MERGE` the pull-request.
7. Let me know you have pushed. I will either:
    * `Approve` your changes, or 
    * `Request fixes` by adding comments to your `pull-request`. You can either make the changes I comment on **OR** we 
    can hop on a call and do it together if you have questions.
8. Once you have successfully completed the Notes and Homework, I'll approve the changes and have you merge them into master.

## Other
* Feel free to do more than one day of work, but before moving on to a new Day all the previous Day's work must first be
merged into master (meaning I approved it and you did everything correctly).
  
* It's a good idea to review the Notes files every day to remind yourself of the different concepts you are learning. Having
a strong foundation in these basics is key. As long as you have that, you'll be able to do the more complicated stuff later.
  
* You can create new files as well, for example `Day1Extra.py` to practice your skills more. Look at the tasks from the 
original file and see if you can make up your own similar tasks, then complete them.
